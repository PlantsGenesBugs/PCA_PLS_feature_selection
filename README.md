# Use of PCA and PLS in Feature Selection for ML
Here I have worked through two tutorials to practice using principle component analysis and partial least squares regression to select features in machine learning. I've done this as part of my [MSc course in Bioinformatics](https://hub.birmingham.ac.uk/degrees/online-msc-bioinformatics/).  

Inspiration comes from:  
- [Principle Component Regression in Python](https://nirpyresearch.com/principal-component-regression-python/) (tutorial source)
- [A variable selection method for PLS in Python](https://nirpyresearch.com/variable-selection-method-pls-python/) (tutorial source)
- [Variable selection method for PLS](https://www.kaggle.com/code/phamvanvung/variable-selection-method-for-pls) (kaggle content)
